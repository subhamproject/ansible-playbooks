Special Tags
There are two special tags named always and never.

ALWAYS - Always run the task unless you explicitly use --skip-tags to stop running the task.
NEVER - A task will never run unless you explicitly use the --tags flag to run the task.
In any case, if you want to skip tasks that are tagged with the "always" tag then you have to use skip tags.
